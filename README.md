# MASM-Projects
My assembly projects using MASM

This project uses Direct X 8.1 graphics library; transformed for MASM assembler.

My plans:

1. Set the window title message. ----> Completed.
2. Code organization (move to different .asm files)   ------> Completed
3. Create Messageboxes, tables, charts, etc ----> Some, will add more.

4. Get to use my Direct X library as much as possible in this console application. ----> Has problems with assembling.



Work in progress.
